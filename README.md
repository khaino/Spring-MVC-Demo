# Spring-MVC-Demo 

<p>I upload this code for those who are new to Spring MVC and want to follow <a href="http://docs.spring.io/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/index.html">Developing a Spring Framework MVC application step-by-step</a> toturial. I use Maven for this demo and made few changes so that I can use latest version of Spring. I also use <b>Postgres</b> instead of <b>hsqldb</b></p>
